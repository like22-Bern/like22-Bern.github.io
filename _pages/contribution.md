# Call for submission of contributed videos

LIKE22 calls for short contributions by early-career researchers (at both graduate student and postdoc levels) in form of short videos.

Contributed video presentations of maximum 5 minutes should be submitted in **MP4** or **MOV** format to [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/LIKE2022/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/LIKE2022/) until **~~December 17th~~ extended to December 21st 23:59 anytime on earth**.  

There will be dedicated time during the event to [broadcast selected contributions](/program/#tuesday-11th-january-2022) and also to have a [Question and Answer session](/program/#thursday-13th-january-2022) with finalists competing for prizes awarded by the [Scientific Committee](/committees/#scientific-committee-in-progress). 500 Swiss Francs will be awarded for the top-ranked video in each category (graduate student and postdoc level, respectively).

Note that a short summary possibly including a few selected references can be provided via the abstract field of the submission website. When provided, the additional material will be available in the video description.
