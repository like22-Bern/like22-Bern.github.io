# Contributing to LIKE22

LIKE22 calls for short contributions by early-career researchers (at both graduate student and postdoc levels) in form of short videos.

Contributed video presentations of maximum 5 minutes should be submitted in **MP4** or **MOV** format to [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/LIKE2022/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/LIKE2022/) until **December 17th 23:59 anytime on earth**.  

There will be dedicated time during the event to broadcast selected contributions, and also to have a Question and Answer session with finalists competing for prizes awarded by the Scientific Committee.
