Welcome!

This event, to take place between January 10th to 14th 2022 (electronically + in Bern depending on sanitary conditions) is a winter school and workshop with main topics 

  *  kernel embeddings from theory to applications,   

  *  kecent advances in Gaussian Process modelling,  

  *  active learning for accelerated inference.
