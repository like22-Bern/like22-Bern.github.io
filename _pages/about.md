LIKE22 is a winter school and workshop that will take place between January 10th to 14th 2022 (electronically + in Bern depending on sanitary conditions), with main topics

  *  kernel embeddings from theory to applications,   

  *  recent advances in Gaussian Process modelling,  

  *  active learning for accelerated inference. 

The first day of the event aims at covering basics of the aforementioned topics over four introductory courses. The other days of the event are designed to allow invited speakers to present and discuss ongoing research and state of the art results. See the [program](/program) for the complete schedule.

Registration (free of charge) is highly encouraged for organizational purpose.
